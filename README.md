# Multiple-Regression-and-Correlation-Analysis-in-R
This repository demonstrates correlation and multiple regression analysis in R, using a Sales dataset.   The analysis explores the effect of Advertising Spend and Store Size on Monthly Sales.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `data/` â†’ Contains the dummy dataset (`dummy_regression_data.xlsx`)  
- `scripts/` â†’ Main R script for running correlation & regression (`regression_analysis.R`)  
- `plots/` â†’ Generated plots (e.g., Actual vs Predicted, Residuals)  
- `results/` â†’ Stores regression model outputs (e.g., summary tables)  
- `README.md` â†’ Documentation & navigation

## ðŸ”¬ Research Questions

1. Is there a significant correlation between **Monthly Sales** and the independent variables (**Advertising Spend**, **Store Size**)?  
2. Do **Advertising Spend** and **Store Size** significantly predict **Monthly Sales** in a regression model?

## ðŸ“Š Hypotheses

**Correlation Tests**  
- H0: No significant correlation between Monthly Sales and predictors.  
- H1: Significant correlation exists.  

**Regression Model**  
- H0: Advertising Spend and Store Size do not significantly predict Monthly Sales (Î²1 = Î²2 = 0).  
- H1: At least one predictor significantly predicts Monthly Sales.
