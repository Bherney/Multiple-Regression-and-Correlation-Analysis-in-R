## ❓ Research Questions

1. Is there a significant correlation between **Monthly Sales** and the independent variables (**Advertising Spend**, **Store Size**)?  
2. Do **Advertising Spend** and **Store Size** significantly predict **Monthly Sales** in a regression model?  

---

## 📑 Hypotheses

**Correlation Tests**  
- **H0:** No significant correlation between Monthly Sales and predictors.  
- **H1:** Significant correlation exists.  

**Regression Model**  
- **H0:** Advertising Spend and Store Size do not significantly predict Monthly Sales (β1 = β2 = 0).  
- **H1:** At least one predictor significantly predicts Monthly Sales.

## 🔎 Summary of Findings

- **Advertising Spend** is significantly correlated with Monthly Sales (*p = 0.03*), while **Store Size** is not (*p = 0.15*).  
- Regression analysis shows:  
  - **Advertising Spend** significantly predicts sales (*β = 0.18, p = 0.048*).  
  - **Store Size** is not a significant predictor (*p = 0.23*).  
- The overall regression model is significant (*F(2,47) = 3.23, p = 0.048*) but explains only about **12% of the variance (R² = 0.12)**.  
- Visual diagnostics confirm the model fits reasonably but with limited predictive power.
